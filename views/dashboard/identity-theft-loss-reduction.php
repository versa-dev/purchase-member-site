<h2>How does it work?</h2>

The Merchant process a sale including accepting payment.<br>
The Merchant sends WebPicID the buyer information and the total amount of the sale.<br>
(Use the same software for the payment post without the card info.)<br>
<p></p>
<p>Advise  the buyer:</p>
“We protect you from identity theft losses by verifying your identity at WebPicID.com."<br>
“Press here to continue to WebPicID.com or find the site via a web browser."<br>

WebPiciD sends the Buyer a Notification<br>
There are only 4 possible responses to a Notification:<br> 
Authorization<br>
WebPicID advises the Merchant that the Buyer verified their identity and authorized the sale.<br>
Declined<br>
WebPicID advises that Merchant that the Buyer verified their identity and declined the sale.<br>
Ignored<br>
WebPicID does not advise the Merchant of anything.<br>
In all cases there is no fraud loss to wither party.<br> The merchant has payment and the goods,
Fraud<br>
WebPicID advises that the buyer verified their identity and declined the sale as a Fraud.<br>
WebPicid sends the Buyer and the Merchant a Fraud Report by Secure Message.<br>
Declined the sale is cancelled and the fuds are refunded.<br>
Authorized The sale is verified as bona fide.<br> The Merchant keeps the payment and ships the goods.<br>
Ignored The buyer is not responding.<br>
<br>
Most people making a payment for goods or services are online waiting for the shipping details.<br>
A delayof 24 hours may not mean anything.<br>
<br>
What happens in all these cases?
The goods are released when the sale is authorized.<br>
A declined sale is canceled.<br>
The ignored sale will sit until it is resolved or canceled.<br>
Sooner or later someone will notice that they have a charge on their card and call.<br>
Reminders can be sent at regular intervals.<br>
There is no fee to check each sale.<br>
