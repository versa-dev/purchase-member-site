       <p> Enhance your protection from ID theft losses.<br>
Pre Registration sets up a profile at WebPicID.<br>
Create Logon and Password<br>
Register<br>
Provide Identification<br>
Have an Agent Affirm your identity.<br>
Wait for Notification or Secure Message before paying.<br><br>

The benefit of pre-registering is we already have a log on ID , password, and challenge word.<br>
Individuals are Notified 24/7 when their identity is used at a WebPicID Merchant.<br>
ID Theft maybe detected earlier and losses avoided.<br>
There is less chance of a successful fraud.<br>
Secure Message, Family Protection, Safe Purchase, Share a Merchant, and Refer a Merchant all require a paid Membership to use the service.</p>
